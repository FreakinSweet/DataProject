# Final Project: North Korea, and Manzini, Swaziland

by: Shane Evanson

###### Something to note, regarding LMIC change:
 Prior to Project 3, I chose North Korea because it's an interesting backwards state that I wanted to learn more about. However, it lacks data that I needed for the third project, so I had to end up switching to Swaziland. As a result, I don't have the content from Project 1 and 2 for Swaziland, or the content for Project 3 and 4 for North Korea, and which LMIC that I am discussing switches back and forth, depending on whether I have charts to support my claims or not for that country.

### Swaziland: Administrative Borders and Subdivisons

Swaziland has 4 provinces and 55 cities within its borders. As can be seen in the 3d topographical plot (with overlayed roadways), the borderlines of the country roughly follow the mountain ridges that line the province of Manzini. The same applies elsewhere in Swaziland, and to its international borders.

### North Korea: Population

As shown in the animation, only one subdivision of North Korea really has a significant population, which is Pyongyang city. The distribution of population all centers around Pyongyang-namdo province, decreasing as one goes further from it. This makes a lot of sense, since Pyongyang is the capitol of North Korea where the government is centered, Kim Jong Un resides, and all of the resources are.

When comparing the population of North Korea against other geospatial covariates, it did not appear to depend on any individual covariate. Topography,
